noobOsu
=======

This is just a probably bad clone or at least attempt at cloning the game osu! by @peppy.

All test maps have been mapped by me, the songs used belong to their respective artists.

# About this project

This project is just made for fun and by no means an attempt at replacing your
osu! stable/lazer installation. I am working on this project not too seriously,
but updates to this github repository won't happen too far apart from each other.
I am only going to implement the standard osu! gamemode for now, maybe mania later
but ONLY if I have enough interest and time.

If you want to help please contact/dm me on discord first before commiting (`GAMINGNOOB#3589`).

# How to use Skins and Beatmaps

To use a skin or beatmap, just copy them to the `Skins` or `Songs` folders respectively
from your osu! stable install. No further steps required.
